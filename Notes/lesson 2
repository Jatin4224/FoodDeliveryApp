///igniting our app

i hope u understand evey concept in our prev blog lets now learn more about react

//in this blog we will learn about how to make our app go to production ready .

so let me introduce u first thing -
1.what is npm?

<!-- npm does;t stands for node package manager  -->

//u can give your own name to npm - ill give it name new pop music
It is a package manager for JavaScript programming language and is the default package manager for Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime. npm is used to manage and distribute packages (libraries and modules) of reusable JavaScript code. It allows developers to easily install, share, and manage dependencies for their projects

lets add npm in our project
command-
1.npm init u can do npm init -y but it will skip some points but i want to show u each point
2.now it will ask u package name
-ill give it a name ReactSeries 3.
3.version: (1.0.0)
4.description: This is React series
5.entry point : App.js 6. test command: jest
7.git repos: url
8.keywords: react,jatin 9.
9.author: jatin sharma
10.licence: "ISC"

now it will ask-
is this ok?
yes its okay bro .

-now it has created a json file .

//lets install our dependencies .

the most imp package in our project is - bundler.
what is bundler?
-A bundler is a tool that takes all your JavaScript code, along with any other assets like CSS or images, and combines them into a single file (or a few files) that can be served to the browser.
-it packages your app properly to ship the app to the production .

2.what is parcel/webpack?
Parcel automatically tracks all of the files, configuration, plugins, and dev dependencies that are involved in your build, and granularly invalidates the cache when something changes. It integrates with low-level operating system APIs to determine what files have changed in milliseconds, no matter the project size

what is package.json?
Specifics of npm's package.json handling
This document is all you need to know about what's required in your package.json file. It must be actual JSON, not just a JavaScript object literal.
A lot of the behavior described in this document is affected by the config settings described in config.

//lets install parrcel in our project
when u install any dependency u have same command -
npm install -D parcel
what is -D?
-there are two types of dependencies app can have
1.dev dependencies
-it means genrally required for develeoping phase
2.normal dependencies
-it reuqired for production

for example we need parcel which is dev dependency so this is how we tell to npm we need dev dependincy
by writing -D

now open the package.json file and u will see-

"devDependencies": {
"parcel": "^2.8.3"
}
hw-read about ^ what is this doing to your app?

//now u will see package-lock.json after u isntalled parcel

what is package-lock.json?
-it keeps track of every pacakge is installed.

-it keeps the exact version.

Difference between package.json and package-lock.json?

package.json: This file is primarily used for managing and documenting metadata about the project, including its name, version, author, dependencies, scripts, and other configuration details. It acts as a manifest for the project.

package-lock.json: This file is generated and updated automatically by npm when installing or updating packages. It is used to lock the exact versions of dependencies installed in the project, ensuring reproducibility and consistent installations across different environments.

Dependency Specification:

package.json: It contains the list of dependencies required for the project, along with their desired version ranges specified using semantic versioning or specific version numbers.

package-lock.json: It includes the specific resolved versions of all the dependencies, their sub-dependencies, and their exact installation locations. It acts as a snapshot of the dependency tree for ensuring consistent installations.

//one more thing is created in our project -
node_modules

what is node_modules?is it good to push node_modules to github?
-The node_modules folder is a folder that is created when you install packages using the Node Package Manager (npm). It stores the packages and their dependencies that your project requires.
It is generally not a good idea to push the node_modules folder to GitHub. This is because the node_modules folder can be very large and can contain sensitive information, such as API keys. Additionally, the node_modules folder can change frequently, which can make it difficult to track changes to your project.
If you are working on a team project, it is best to have each team member install the node_modules folder on their own machine. This will help to ensure that everyone is using the same version of the packages and that the node_modules folder is not accidentally pushed to GitHub.

-every package u install has its own package.json and own dependencies.

- the best practice is to keep this node_modules in the file .gitignore.

<!-- - file : .gitignore
  -/node_modules -->

Q)is it important to put package-lock.json and package.json on to your git repo?
-yes if u have package.json and package-lock u can recreate your node_modules .
that is why it is not required to put node_modules on your git.

-whatever u regenrate just dont put it on git.

now lets take a break .

//part 2

now we will write command -
npx parcel index.html

and now u will see -
Server running at http-localhost url

congrats u hosted your app on your server.
localhost.
parcel is doing this for us.

//what is npx?
-executing package it will execute the parcel.

NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them.
NPX does not install packages, so package pollution on the machine is not a concern.
The most common application of NPX is the create-react-app command. Since we only need to use it once, i.e., while initializing the project, we do not install it.

//now if u remember we have first injected react in our app usind cdn links right.
but this is not a prefered way to bring react in our project why?
-fetching from cdn is costly operation it will fetch react from unpkd.com suppose
i already have react in my node_modules its more easy as compare to creating react from another network

//so lets see 2nd method of creating react -
command-
npm install react
//have u notice i dont write -D here because i want react as a normal dependency not dev dependency .

now check package.json-
ull see
"dependencies": {
"react": "^18.2.0"
}

so we have now installed react similarly isntall react dom also
comand-
npm i react-dom
//dont panic npm i is a small version of npm install

now again check package.json
ull see
"dependencies": {
"react": "^18.2.0",
"react-dom": "^18.2.0"
}

it means we have succesfully install react and react dom .

now we no longer need cdn so remove it from the index.html file .

lets start our server again and check its working or not.
oops we got an error -
Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined
at App.js:8:16

//why this error?
-we have just installed package but our code does't understand where is this react is coming from?
-ill use this react in our code ill use it using import keyword.

code- APP.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

now start the server and we will get new error -
Parcel encountered errors
@parcel/transformer-js: Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.

//we need this import we need to tell browser this is not a normal browser scropt its a module we have to write :
->index.html

- <script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>

//lets explore parcel superpowers:
-dEV bUILD
-local server
-HMR-hot module replacement ->automatic refershing the page
-parcel uses File watching alogrithem -written in c++ to do HMR.
-caching - faster builds
-image optimization
-minification
-bundling
-compress
-for example - pm modi is react and parcel is amit shah .
-Consistent Hashing
-code splitting
-Differential Bundling - support older browsers
-Diagnostic
-good Error handling
-HTTPS
--tree shaking- remove unused code
-Different dev and Prod bundles - to crate prod build u hvae to use command -> npx parcel build index.html
-Readmore about parcel on parcel documentation.
-it makes your react app faster.

///to create prod build u hvae to use command -> npx parcel build index.html
note - u will get the error:
"description": "lets create foodapp using react ",

> 5 | "main": "App.js",
> | ^^^^^^^^ Did you mean "App.html"?

to fix this error u have to open package.json and remove-
"main": "App.js",

now delete the dist file and than write command again
n -> npx parcel build index.html
it will again creat dist file with 3 files:
âœ¨ Built in 871ms

dist\index.html 324 B 1.46s
dist\index.8d566482.css 84 B 104ms
dist\index.68db4388.js 138.78 KB 834ms

//now u can delete the parcel-cache file and write command-
npx parcel index.html
-it will create .parcel-cache again soo
we can genrate dist and parcel-cache again right so u know what to do whatever we can regenrate we dont push to github .
so we can put this on .gitignore .

we push our code to git and server fetches from it and what we write commands server also have that commands the copy of nodemodules in our local is different and ins erver is different server has it own dist folder.thats why we dont put parcel-cache,dist,node modules

now we have build production ready app .
lets make app comfortable for differetn browsers .

-browser list
-u have to tell your project what browsers your app will support

configure it in your package.json:
add

"browsersList": [
"last 2 versions"
]

example->
"browsersList": [
"last 2 chrome versions",
"last 2 firefox versions"
]

this means it might or might not work on other browsers but it will definetly work on chrome and firefox versions.

how to know what to write ? check this website :

congrats we have make our app production ready.
