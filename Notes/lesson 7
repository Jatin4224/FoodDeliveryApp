import React, { useEffect } from "react";

//1. how useEffect works

//importing
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

//useEffect call using two arguments
// 1.CALLBACKL FUNCTION
// 2.DEPENDENCY ARRAY

//imp interview question when this useEffect is called?
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("useeffect called")
}, []);

-use Effect IS CALLED AFTER every time component renders but because we put dependencya rray it changes the behaviour (its not mendatory)

//if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render.
//every time its called after every render 

//if dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on initial render(just ones) - not getting called again and again.

//what if we put something on dependency array -> then useEffect is called everytime the dependncy inside and array is updated useEffect is called.


When is useEffect called?
No Dependency Array (useEffect(() => {...})):

Called after every render.
Empty Dependency Array (useEffect(() => {...}, [])):

Called only once after the initial render (mounting phase).
With Dependencies (useEffect(() => {...}, [dependency1, dependency2])):

Called after every render if any dependency has changed.



//part 2
// useState imp points :

1.never use useState outside of your component
2.it is used for creating local state variables inside your functional component .
3.try to call this hooks on the top.so u dont have lot of inconsitency in your ConvolverNode.apply
4.never used your useState INSIDE A if else .this can create inconsitency in your program 
5.never create inside for loop, and function .
6.it meant to be created insdie the functional component on the top .  


//PART 3 = REACT ROUTES 


for this im using javascript library :
https://reactrouter.com/en/main



how to install this library inside our project 

command :
npm i react-router-dom 


1.whenever we have to develope routes we have to create routing configuration 
open our root componenet app.js 

import {createBrowserRouter} from "react-router-dom";


const appRouter = createBrowserRouter ([
    {
        path: "/",
        //load my homepage 
        element: <AppLayout />,
    },

    {
        path:"/about",
        element: <About />,

    },

    
])

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<AppLayout />);

//lets creat About us page 

this is your task create about us component u can create about us page by your own u can add your resume there your choice and import it in app.js file 


//now  I  have created our configuration now i need to provide this configuration to render it.for that i hvae one more component react dom this 
// this RouterProvider will provide this routing configuration.

import {createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider} from "react-router-dom";

react router provides two component
1.createBrowserRouter :
This is the recommended router for all React Router web projects. It uses the DOM History API to update the URL and manage the history stack.
2.<RouterProvider> :
All data router objects are passed to this component to render your app and enable the rest of the data APIs.


//earlier we just rendering the AppLayout directly.
root.render(<AppLayout />);


root.render(RouterProvider router={appRouter})


//so now this will start working u can check by browsing /About. 


// note: if u go to the react router documentation u'll se multiple routers over there but i personally suggest u to use the createBrowserRouter.
